## Pin description of MCP3008 

If you refer to the MCP3008 datasheet, you can easily obtain information about the pins. The MCP3008 is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chip commonly used to convert analog signals into digital values, particularly in platforms like the Raspberry Pi, for reading sensors and similar analog devices.

## mcp3008Setup()

```cpp
#include <mcp3008.h>

int mcp3008Setup(int pinBase, int spiChannel);
```

### pinBase 

Although MCP3008 has eight channels from CH0 to CH7, WiringPi allows you to specify them from 0 to 7 using the pinBase parameter in the mcp3008Setup function.

For example, in mcp3008Setup(BASE), the BASE represents the base pin number corresponding to the CH0 pin of MCP3008. If ***BASE is 100, CH0 is mapped to 100, CH1 to 101, CH2 to 102, and CH3 to 103***. Therefore, depending on the pinBase value used when calling the function, each channel of MCP3008 is assigned to a specific pin.

```cpp
#define BASE 100
#define SPI_CHAN 0

mcp3004Setup(BASE, SPI_CHAN);
```

spiChannel specifies the SPI channel to be used for communication between the MCP3008 and the Raspberry Pi, typically using the values 0 or 1.

### analogRead()

```cpp
analogValue = analogRead(ANALOG_PIN);
```

The analogRead(ANALOG_PIN) function is used to read analog values from an analog pin. The constant ANALOG_PIN represents the pin number from which the analog input is read.

The analogRead() function returns an integer value ranging from 0 to 1023, representing the strength or intensity of the analog input signal. In this range, 0 corresponds to the minimum value (0V), and 1023 corresponds to the maximum value (5V or another configured reference voltage).
