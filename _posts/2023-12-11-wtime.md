# set wtime() to measure processing time 


To calculate the elapsed time in Processing, you can declare a double-type variable to store the time before and after the processing, by obtaining the time at the beginning and end

```cpp
double start, finish;
```

We can place the respective variables as follows.

```cpp
start =wtime(); 
matrix_mul(a,b,c,len); 
finish = wtime();

printf("processed time : %f (s)\n", finish-start);
```
## definition of wtime()

```cpp
 #include <time.h>
 #include <sys/time.h>

double wtime(){
    //static int sec = -1;
    struct timeval tv;
    gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
    //if (sec<0) sec = tv.tv_sec;

    //printf("%ld %d %ld\n", tv.tv_sec, sec, tv.tv_usec);
    return (tv.tv_sec/*-sec*/)+1.0e-6*tv.tv_usec;
}
```

***tv.tv_sec*** represents time in seconds, returning the elapsed seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Unix epoch). ***tv.tv_usec*** represents microseconds and provides the elapsed time in microseconds (Âµs) with a precision of six digits.

## structure of timeval

```console
struct timeval {
    time_t      tv_sec;  /* Seconds */
    suseconds_t tv_usec; /* Microseconds */
};
```
Describes times in seconds and microseconds.

## gettimeofday()

```cpp
int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);
```

- tv: A pointer to a struct timeval that will be filled with the current time.

- tz: A pointer to a struct timezone that was used in older implementations. It's now generally ignored and can be set to NULL.
