## Include "stdio.h" header file 
>The stdio. h header file declares functions that deal with standard input and output

```c
#include "stdio.h"
```

stdio header file includes FILE structure that is data type to put information of file in, which is file pointer referring to stream file. 


## Declaration of __stdout
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
FILE __stdout;
```
The 'input stream' and 'output stream' used in console input and output functions like "printf()" and "scanf()" are automatically created and destroyed. These streams are generated automatically when the program is executed and are terminated when the program exits.

The input stream is used when the program reads data from external sources, while the output stream is used when the program outputs results to the external environment. Typically, these streams are connected to standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout).

|stream|description|device|
|---|---|---|
|stdin|standard input|keyboard|
|stdout|standard output|terminal|
|stderr|standard error|terminal|

## Transmit data (8 bits at a time) through USART2 connection
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN PFP */
int fputc(int ch, FILE* stream){
	HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, (uint8_t*)&ch, 1, 0xFFFF);
	return ch;
}
```
The functions mentioned for transmitting one character at a time include "putc()," "fputc()," and "putchar()." These functions perform the same task, and they use a specified stream, denoted as __stream, for the operation. For example:

### putc() Function:
It has the form int putc(int character, FILE* stream).
Writes the character to the designated file stream (FILE* stream).
The return value is the ASCII code of the written character on success, and it returns EOF in case of an error.
### fputc() Function:
It has the form int fputc(int character, FILE* stream).
Performs the same role as "putc()" by writing a character to a file stream.
The return value is the ASCII code of the written character on success, and it returns EOF in case of an error.
### putchar() Function:
It has the form int putchar(int character).
Writes the character to the standard output stream. It is commonly used for console output.
The return value is the ASCII code of the written character on success, and it returns EOF in case of an error.
These functions are used for character output, with "putc()" and "fputc()" being applicable to arbitrary file streams, while "putchar()" is primarily used for console output, targeting the standard output stream (stdout).

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int putchar(int ch);
int putc(int ch, FILE *stream);
int fputc(int ch, FILE *stream);
```


> ***now you can use printf, displaying any strings on connected terminal (putty etc.)***
