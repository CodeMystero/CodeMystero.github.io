## The keypad of the door lock is configured as follows.

|Command| Function|
|---|---|
|&&&& + *| 4 digits of number input are compared to password set 0000 as default right with '*' button pressed at the end|
|0000+#<br>-> &&&&+*| '#' after 4 zeros will turn display into password change display where user can covert password by pressing 4 digits of &&&&, '*' to be pressed to confirm changed password|
|c|user can close the door by pressing this key, then LED will be turned off|
|p|this is easter egg for developer to check current password|

>& = any number from keypad

## How it works

If the door lock's password is correct, the door opens. Since this is a virtual door, the opening is represented by the LED lighting up.
